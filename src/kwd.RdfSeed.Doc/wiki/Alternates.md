# Alternate .NET RDF libraries

Before embarking to create this project, I tried to leverage 
some other libraries. If this library doesn't suit your RDF needs,
perhapse try:

## dotNetRdf 
A big library with lots of bits n bobs.
If you need a whole pile of features, then
[dotNetRdf](https://github.com/dotnetrdf)

## json-ld
A simpler rdf library focused on JSON-LD.

[json-ld](https://github.com/linked-data-dotnet/json-ld.net) is a port of a java library.
