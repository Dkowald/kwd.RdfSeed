# Overview
A RDF library for .NET core.

Quick notes
1. Nodes are mapped to native .NET types. eg xsd:integer is a int.
2. Minimal nodes created; where possible the core node factory returns the 
same node, rahter than a new instance.
3. NTriple file support.
4. Linq style interface for queries
5. Fluent API for updates.
